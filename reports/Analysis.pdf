Business insights inferred from the graphs produced in the EDA file. Here are the following insights:

1. Customer Distribution by Region: South America has the highest proportion of customers (30%), indicating strong market penetration. Focused strategies in this region could further solidify market dominance.
2. Balanced Customer Base: Europe and North America follow closely, with similar percentages of customers. These regions present stable growth opportunities for targeted campaigns.
3.Asia's Potential: Asia has the lowest customer share among the regions. Expansion efforts and localized marketing could tap into this underrepresented market.
4. High Engagement in South America: The high customer count in South America suggests it could be a primary revenue driver. Prioritizing customer retention here is essential.
5. Growth Opportunities in North America: Despite a decent customer base, North America's percentage indicates room for more aggressive marketing efforts.

Clustering Results Report

1. Number of Clusters Formed
The clustering process resulted in 4 clusters. The breakdown of customers in each cluster is as follows:
Cluster 0: 58 customers
Cluster 1: 60 customers
Cluster 2: 28 customers
Cluster 3: 53 customers

2. Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index)
The Davies-Bouldin Index (DB Index) is a measure of clustering quality. Lower values indicate better-defined clusters.
DB Index: 1.06
This value suggests moderately well-separated clusters.

3. Silhouette Score
The Silhouette Score measures how similar an object is to its own cluster compared to other clusters. It ranges from -1 to 1.
Silhouette Score: 0.31
This indicates that the clusters are moderately compact but may have some overlap.

4. Cluster Features
The clustering was performed using three key customer features:
TotalTransactions: Total number of transactions per customer.
TotalAmountSpent: Total monetary value of transactions per customer.
AvgTransactionValue: Average value of each transaction.

5. Summary Statistics
Dataset Size: 199 customers
Feature Details:
TotalTransactions ranges from 1 to 11.
TotalAmountSpent ranges from $335.52 to $10,673.87.
AvgTransactionValue ranges from $335.52 to $1,323.13.

6. Observations
Cluster Differences: Clusters appear to group customers based on spending habits and transaction frequency.
High spenders with frequent transactions form one cluster.
Low spenders with fewer transactions form another cluster.
Cluster Range Length: The clustering was tested across 9 possible cluster configurations to find the optimal number of clusters.
Inertia: The inertia values (not shown here) were likely analyzed to assess the optimal cluster count.

7. Recommendations
For Marketing: Focus on Cluster 3 for high-value customers with frequent transactions.
For Engagement: Identify Cluster 2 customers (smallest group) for personalized offers to improve engagement.
Further Analysis: Consider additional features, such as customer region or product categories, to refine clustering.
